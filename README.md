# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to handle cases where a user ID is not found.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a corrected version with robust error handling.
